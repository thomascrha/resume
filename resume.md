### Owner and Operator, 9bitbyte

**July 2013 - current, Sydney, NSW**

A small business that I run on the side, primarily for contracting work.

## Achievements

**Fusion:** a distributed system built for Dragonfly Technologies used inhouse to manage and monitor customer’s network, application and hardware infrastructure. Workflow services could be created, executed and monitored all within the application. These services could then also be published to a customer portal, allowing them to be run by external customers – providing them with self-service options.

**Discovery tool:** a tool developed for Telstra to crawl  device assets on a network. The engine works by connecting to a set of known devices – collects data from them and then attempts to ‘crawl’ (ssh to any devices that device has knowledge of) – and in doing so is able to traverse a complex network structure to find all devices that are currently connected to that network.

**End-to-end selenium testing suite:** a client-side testing suite implemented with server-side test. Included was a tool that allowed for recording of xpaths as the user clicked through a selenium hosted web session. This could then be used to generate code for the test. 

## Projects 

**[whynes](https://github.com/thomascrha/whynes)** a 6502 Nintendo emulator written in Python.

**[textual-game-of-life](https://github.com/thomascrha/textual-game-of-life)** an implementation of Conway's game of life (cellular automata) in the terminal using textual.
